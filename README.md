# Python Variable Annotations

This project contains tasks related to Python type annotations.

## Tasks

1. **Basic annotations - add**: Write a function `add` that takes two floats and returns their sum.
2. **Basic annotations - concat**: Write a function `concat` that takes two strings and returns their concatenated string.
3. **Basic annotations - floor**: Write a function `floor` that takes a float and returns its floor value.
4. **Basic annotations - to string**: Write a function `to_str` that takes a float and returns its string representation.
5. **Define variables**: Define and annotate variables as specified.
6. **Complex types - list of floats**: Write a function `sum_list` that takes a list of floats and returns their sum.
7. **Complex types - mixed list**: Write a function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum.
8. **Complex types - string and int/float to tuple**: Write a function `to_kv` that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple with the string and the square of the int/float.
9. **Complex types - functions**: Write a function `make_multiplier` that takes a float and returns a function that multiplies a float by the given multiplier.
10. **Let's duck type an iterable object**: Annotate a function that takes an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples containing each sequence and its length.
