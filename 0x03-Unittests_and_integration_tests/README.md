# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Overview

This project involves writing unit and integration tests for various utility functions and classes in Python. The focus is on ensuring the functions work as expected in isolation (unit tests) and when integrated with other parts of the system (integration tests).

## Running the Tests

All tests can be executed using the `unittest` module. To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
$ python -m unittest test_utils.py
$ python -m unittest test_client.py
